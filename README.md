# Hyperapp Types Tests

This is the [dtslint](https://github.com/microsoft/dtslint)-based types test suite for the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) definitions used in [Hyperapp](https://hyperapp.dev/). A copy of the type definitions is kept here for the testing.

## Setup & Usage

2. Download or clone this repo into a new folder.
3. Run these CLI commands within that folder:

    ```sh
    npm install
    npm test
    ```

## Unsolved Cases

Some test cases are currently unsolved. They are preceded by a `TODO` comment. To "see" these tests, remove the space after the `$` on the comment lines containing [dtslint assertions](https://github.com/microsoft/dtslint#write-tests).

## Contributing
